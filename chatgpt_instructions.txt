Let assume I have a txt file categories.txt that contain words in categories. Example:

category1: word1, word2
category2: word2, word4, word5

Then I have another file with a lot of words. Example:

word100, word31, word1, word3

Write a Python program to remove the words that belong to any category from the long word list.
